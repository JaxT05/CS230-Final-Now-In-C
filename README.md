# Project Description/Specifications

"In this project you will create an C program that will read a hexadecimal digit from the user and output its 4 bits binary equivalent. For example, if the user inputs E, your program should output 1110. Similarly, if the user inputs 5 you should output 0101. Note that only one digit is input at a time.

The program should continue to accept user input and output the binary equivalent until the value X is input, when it should stop execution. Print “_-_” at the end.

Your program must make use of arithmetic and/or logical shift operations as well as bitwise Boolean operations."
